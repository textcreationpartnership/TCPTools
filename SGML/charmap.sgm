<!-- MAKING .ent FILES

    Make character changes to this file (charmap.sgm), then at the 
    command line run the following perl scripts to generate the files
    that you need:
    
    o To generate an sgml ent file containing tcp character entites:
       perl tcp-charmap-entmake-sgm-tcp.pl > Eebochar.ent
    
    o To generate an sgml ent file containing tcp, isolat1, isolat2, 
    isonum, isopub, isotech, isogrk1, isocyr1 and teigrk entities:
       perl tcp-charmap-entmake-sgm-all.pl > Eebochar-all.ent
    
    o To generate an xml ent file with entities including private use
    characters containing tcp, isolat1, isolat2, isonum, isopub, 
    isotech, isogrk1, isocyr1 and teigrk entities:
       perl tcp-charmap-entmake-xml-all.pl > Eebochar-xml-all.ent 
    
    o To generate an xml ent file with viewable entities (not private use
    characters) containing tcp, isolat1, isolat2, isonum, isopub, 
    isotech, isogrk1, isocyr1 and teigrk entities:
       perl tcp-charmap-entmake-xml-all-view.pl > Eebochar-xml-all-view.ent
    
    o To generate an htm page that shows all the tcp, isolat1, isolat2, 
    isonum, isopub, isotech, isogrk1, isocyr1 and teigrk entities:
       perl tcp-charmap-htm.pl > charmap.htm 
       
Alternatively, reduce this to five steps:

    o Save the existing charmap.sgm file under a name with a datestamp, e.g. charmap.20061212.sgm
    o Revise the charmap.sgm file and save it as charmap.sgm
    o Validate charmap.sgm
    o Type new_ent (which invokes the batch file new_ent.bat)
          This script creates copies (*.bak) of 
            Eebochar.ent
            Eebochar-all.ent
            Eebochar-xml-all.ent
            Eebochar-xml-all-view.ent
            charmap.htm charmap.htm
          and text versions of 
           charmap.sgm (charmap.sgm.txt)
           Eebochar.ent (Eebochar.ent.txt)
          and generates a new version of
            Eebochar.ent
            Eebochar-all.ent
            Eebochar-xml-all.ent
            Eebochar-xml-all-view.ent
            charmap.htm
     o SFTP new versions to library web server

/www/wordpress/web/docs/code/  etc

            Eebochar.ent to /docs/code
            Eebochar-all.ent to /docs/code
            Eebochar-xml-all.ent to /docs/code

            Eebochar.ent.txt to /docs/dox
            charmap.sgm.txt to /docs/dox

    2011-08-30 pfs   added TCP entities corresponding to some of the medievalist additions made to Unicode in version 5.1
                     (here treated as non-displayable), mostly simple glyph variants that we do not normally distinguish 
                     from the base character:

    2011-08-30       considered but rejected idea of adding Roman numeral ranges, which we have no
                     need or ability to distinguish from corresponding letters I/I i/i V/V etc.
                     
    2011-09-30       added following alchemical symbols in response to
                     their presence in WB1088.
                     
                     bezoarMin
		     verdigris
		     oil2
		     skull
		     retort
		     orpiment
		     
    2011-09-30        revised unicode equivalents for the following entity in order to take 
                      account of alchemical symbols added in Unicode 6.0:
                      
                      *1F741	QUICKLIME               exact quick lime       formerly E0AA [PUA code point now reused]
		     

    2011-09-30       revised following descriptions, mostly to allow for
                     additional formal or semantic variety
  
                     arsenic
                     day
                     night
                     arsenic2
                     vitriol series
                     vinegar2
                     
    2011-10-28 pfs added TCP entities lbrace and rbrace (ordinary left and 
               right curly brace but mapped to decorative variants since the 
               proper brace characters are reserved for use in abbr expansions)
    2011-11-01 pfs added TCP entities male and female (which for the moment
               we choose to distinguish from Mars and Venus.)
    2012-02-13 pfs added TCP entities cmbibreve and spcibreve (combining
               and spacing forms of the inverted breve). Only one of these
               occurs in Unicode (the combining form), and visually they
               are probably indistinguishable from circumflex, so we
               will display and export them as combining and spacing 
               circumflexes. Added to accommodate odd bit of romanized
               Chinese, where the meaning of all the diacritics is
               wholly mysterious.
    2012-02-20 pfs added TCP entity for lower-case lunate sigma;
               redefined upper-case lunate sigma so that it displays
               with the correct Unicode code point instead of a substitute.
    2012-04-04 pfs tentatively added TCP entities for the critical sigla 
               obelus (or obelisk) and asterisk as
               adapted by Origen in his Hexapla from Greek grammarians and
               used by his successors including Thomas of Harquel in the
               Harklean (Syriac) translation of the Bible. Forms and relevance
               of these remain unclear. At the moment, treat them much as we
               moon symbols, that is, use the entity obelus for the obelus 
               (or obelisk), regardless of glyph variant, so long as the
               glyph variation appears insignificant. Otherwise, use one of
               the more specific entities, which align with specific forms.
               
               obelus          general entity
	       asterisc        a special use of the asterisk
	       lemnisc         specific two-dotted form of the obelus, Origen's term (lit. 'ribbon')
	       hypolemnisc     specific dot-below form of the obelus, Origen's term (lit. 'below the ribbon')
	       hyperlemnisc    specific dot-above form of the obelus, added for symmetry's sake (lit. 'above the ribbon')
	       
    2012-05-29 pfs added TCP entity for CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON WITH PERISPOMENI (circumflex), which is not a precomposed character in Unicode, with PUA value.
               
    2012-06-06 pfs added TCP entities:
    
       rdiple		U+E097	display as 203A	Right-pointing Greek diple, display as quotation mark
       ldiple		U+E0A5	display as 2039	Left-pointing Greek diple, display as quotation mark
       ddiple		U+2E16	 		DOTTED RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE = diple periestigmene
       cmbvlineover	U+20D3			COMBINING SHORT VERTICAL LINE OVERLAY

       cmbenclcirover	U+20DD			COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE
       cmbenclsquover	U+20DE			COMBINING ENCLOSING SQUARE
       cmbencltriover	U+20E4			COMBINING ENCLOSING UPWARD POINTING TRIANGLE
       cmbbslashover	U+20E5			COMBINING REVERSE SOLIDUS OVERLAY
       cmbdblvlineover	U+20E6			COMBINING DOUBLE VERTICAL STROKE OVERLAY

    2012-07-13 pfs added TCP entities:
    
       hcolon           U+05C3                  HEBREW PUNCTUATION SOF PASUQ (Hebrew colon w rtl property)
       magnesia         U+E098                  CHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR MAGNESIA or MAGNESIUM (doubtful interpretation)
    
    2012-08-10 pfs revised display equivalents for the two tilted quad-dot punctuation entities (quaddotl and quaddotr)
    2013-03-14 pfs added TCP entities arab-qaf and syri-qaph; rejected sof-pasuq in favor of existing hcolon
    2013-03-21 pfs added TCP entities dnc-repeat, dnc-repeat2, dnc-repeat3, dnc-male, dnc-female, dnc-startover (all assigned PUA codepoints) for symbols used in The Dancing Master and similar books
    2013-07-15 pfs added TCP entity  ipara (inverted pilcrow) as PUA E00A but displayable as if it were lpara
    2014-01-31 pfs added TCP entity subplus (subscripted plus sign) with exact Unicode match in order to capture the baseline plus sign used by early printers as a glyph variant of punctus (period, full stop)
    2014-03-24 pfs added TCP entities for a subset of the Hebrew cantillation marks, following Unicode practice and nomenclature for the most part. 
                               darga
                               etnahta

                               zaquef-qatan
                                 may be expanded as literary warrant necessitates.
                               
    
 2014-03-27 pfs added TCP entity starw with exact Unicode equivalent WHITE STAR U+2606     
 2014-04-14 pfs added TCP entity spclowvertline with exact Unicode equivalent  MODIFIER LETTER LOW VERTICAL LINE U+02CC (occasioned by use of low vertical line in arithmetic to indicate the number of 'places' that may be ignored)
 2014-04-14 pfs added TCP entity cmblowvertline with exact Unicode equivalent COMBINING VERTICAL LINE BELOW U+0329 
 
Reminder: the following codepoints are intended to be indexed as null:

  LEFT CURLY BRACKET U+007B used to supply text-string expansions
  RIGHT CURLY BRACKET U+007D used to surround text-string expansions
  DIVIDES U+2223  used for EOLhyphen
  BROKEN BAR U+00A6 used for editor-supplied EOLhyphen
  BOX DRAWING LIGHT DOUBLE DASH HORIZONTAL U+254C used for syllable- and music-spacing dash

And the following codepoint(s) are intended to be indexed as space:

  BLACK SMALL SQUARE U+25AA used to represent indistinct punctuation mark

<!-- USAGE

  pfs: I think that the 'lossy' converter uses the REPL tags,
  with a preference for those indicated to be represented
  in  Arial Unicode MS, otherwise using the DEFAULT replacement.
  The lossless converter does a straight conversion to unicode
  (PUA if necessary), and therefore uses the UNIC fields instead.
  
  akuster: REPL is for lossy display conversion, and lossless
  conversion uses the EQUIV attribute UNIC.

  akuster: A potential danger that I purposefully left open for future exploitation: in
  charmap.sgm each CHAR is allowed to have multiple EQUIV tags. Just a
  reminder, all the perl programs as I left them will behave unpredictably if
  they encounter CHARs with multiple EQUIV tags.
