<!-- 1.00 PREFACE TO VERSION 1.0 -->
<!--* This is the vendor DTD for Early English Books Online. It was created
    * deleting elements from the TEILITE XML DTD not required in the vendor
    * transcription. The deleted elements are: <gi>, <eg>, <code>, <ident>, <kw>, 
    * <s>, <div>, <div0>, <interpGrp>, <foreign>, <emph>, <socalled>, <mentioned>, 
    * <gloss>, <rs>, <num>, <time>, <sic>, <corr>, <reg>, <ptr>, <ref>, <index>, <divGen>, <xref>,
    * <xptr>, <seg>, <anchor>, <interp>
    * <term> and <name> are retained just for the header.
    * A new element, <letter>, has been created to serve as a compression of the <Q><TEXT><BODY><DIV1>
    * necessary currently for encoding inserted personal letters. This element can be later expanded
    * to remain a valid TEI document.
    * It will thus be a valid TEI document, and expandable to include other 
    * elements within TEILite or the larger TEI tagset.
    * This version was drafted by Perry Willett on 16 June 2000.
    *-->

<!-- I have removed further elements, including everything from the TEIHEADER, CIT, LISTBIBL, and BIBLFULL, and have restored FOREIGN.  I also pared down the attributes. Finally, I removed PB from the content models of TEXT, FRONT, BODY and BACK in order to encourage their appearance within DIVs.  Chris Powell, July/August 2000-->
